# TicTacToe
I tried creating the tic tac toe game with the bare minimum knowledge I gained after doing last 3 projects(one got deleted from my system).
Most of the functions are predefined/hardcoded, will try some other dynamic programming approach later.

I also thought about adding sound effects, but as i am just getting started with javascript, i did not want to get bpred in one singe project only.
I guess this game is pretty simple to undertsand wiith it's basic ugly UI.
